/// SerialSubmitter accepts undelivered messages over a channel from a MessageProcessor.  It is
/// responsible for executing the right strategy to deliver those messages to the destination
/// chain. It is designed to be used in a scenario allowing only one simultaneously in-flight
/// submission, a consequence imposed by strictly ordered nonces at the target chain combined
/// with a hesitancy to speculatively batch > 1 messages with a sequence of nonces, which
/// entails harder to manage error recovery, could lead to head of line blocking, etc.
///
/// The single transaction execution slot is (likely) a bottlenecked resource under steady
/// state traffic, so the SerialSubmitter implemented in this file carefully schedules work
/// items (pending messages) onto the constrained resource (transaction execution slot)
/// according to a policy that incorporates both user-visible metrics (like distribution of
/// message delivery latency and delivery order), as well as message delivery eligibility (e.g.
/// due to (non-)existence of source chain gas payments).
///
/// Messages which failed delivery due to a retriable error are also retained within the
/// SerialSubmitter, and will eventually be retried according to our prioritization rule.
///
/// Finally, the SerialSubmitter ensures that message delivery is robust to destination chain
/// re-orgs prior to committing delivery status to AbacusDB.
///
///
/// Objectives
/// ----------
///
/// A few primary objectives determine the structure of this scheduler:
///
/// 1.  Progress for well-behaved applications should not be inhibited by delivery of messages
///     for which we have evidence of possible issues (i.e., that we have already tried and
///     failed to deliver them, and have retained them for retry). So we should attempt
///     delivery of fresh messages (num_retries=0) before ones that have been failing for a
///     while (num_retries>0)
///
/// 2.  Messages should be delivered in-order, i.e. if msg_a was sent on source chain prior to
///     msg_b, and they're both destined for the same destination chain and are otherwise eligible,
///     we should try to deliver msg_a before msg_b, all else equal. This is because we expect
///     applications may prefer this even if they do not strictly rely on it for correctness.
///
/// 3.  Be [work-conserving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work-conserving_scheduler) w.r.t.
///     the single execution slot, i.e. so long as there is at least one message eligible for
///     submission, we should be working on it, rather than e.g.:
///     *  awaiting something to appear in a channel via tokio::select!
///     *  sitting around with a massive backlog waiting for a time-based retry backoff to
///        expire. What's the point? We should work through the backlog at every opportunity,
///        or we may never clear it!
///
/// Therefore we order the priority queue of runnable messages by the key:
///     <num_retries, leaf_idx>
/// picking the lexicographically least element in the runnable set to execute next.
///
///
/// Implementation
/// --------------
///     
/// Messages may have been received from the MessageProcessor but not yet be eligible for submission.
/// The reasons a message might not be eligible are:
///
///  *  Insufficient interchain gas payment on source chain
///  *  Already delivered to destination chain, e.g. maybe by a different relayer, or the result of
///     a submission attempt just prior to an old incarnation of this task crashing.
///  *  Not whitelisted (currently checked by processor)
///  *  Wrong destination chain (currently checked by processor)
///  *  Checkpoint index < leaf index (currently checked by processor)
///
/// Therefore, we maintain two queues of messages:
///
///   1.  run_queue: messages which are eligible for submission but waiting for
///       their turn to run, since we can only do one at a time.
///
///   2.  wait_queue: messages currently ineligible for submission, due to one of the
///       reasons listed above (e.g. index not covered by checkpoint, insufficient gas, etc).
///
/// Note that there is no retry queue. This is because if submission fails for a retriable
/// reason, the message instead goes directly back on to the runnable queue (though it will be
/// prioritized lower than it was prior to the failed attempt due to the increased
/// num_retries).
///
/// To summarize: each scheduler `tick()`, new messages from the processor are inserted onto
/// the wait queue.  We then scan the wait_queue, looking for messages which can be promoted to
/// the runnable_queue, e.g. by comparing with a recent checkpoint or latest gas payments on
/// source chain. If eligible for delivery, the message is promoted to the runnable queue and
/// prioritized accordingly. Note that for messages that have never been attempted before, they
/// will sort very highly due to num_retries==0 and probably be tried soon.
